<h1>The Sims™ 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack</h1>

<h3>Short description</h3>
<p>Meet your match.</p>

<h3>Long description</h3>
<p>Explore romance as you match with alluring Sims and plan exciting dates in The Sims 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack. Create your Sim’s profile for the Cupid’s Corner dating app, and start meeting matches! New intimate interactions, like cuddling in bed or meeting for a seductive dance, are waiting. Whether your dynamic ends up steamy or strained will depend on what your Sim finds attractive. Pay special attention to those Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs.
<br>
<br>
Purchase now to get the Heartbreak Happens bonus items. Not all love stories have happy endings. Embrace a little heartache with the Cry Me A River Eyeliner, cuddle up with the new Herbert Heart Plushie and start your single life with the Basic Breakup Double Bed (your ex took the bed, but not your dignity...mostly). Available when you order June 27 through September 5**.
<br>
<br>
<b>Plan Hotter Dates</b>  — Check the Cupid’s Corner app for matches that make your Sim’s heart flutter. Then, set up a date with the new date-planning system. You’ll choose where to go and what to do, crafting romantic rendezvous that’ll leave Sims swooning. Sims can connect by playing games, cuddling in bed or taking the Romantic Blanket to a beautiful spot for a special moment.
<br>
<br>
<b>All About Attraction</b> — What works for your Sim? Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs will determine how attracted Sims are to each other. They can include interests, interactions and more. Discover these as your Sims get to know their partners, build relationships and maintain Romantic Satisfaction. Since Sims will like and dislike different interactions, partners might have different satisfaction levels. How Sims interact with each other will also affect whether their Relationship Dynamic is wholesome, steamy, strained or unpredictable.
<br>
<br>
<b>For Lovers of Love</b> — Romance isn’t just a word; it’s a skill that unlocks seductive interactions. For Sims with romantic aspirations, romance is a way of life. Truly hopeless romantics can even become Romance Consultants and make a career out of loving love! As they rise in their career, they’ll earn new ways to promote love and maybe find some cute heart-shaped furniture in their inventories.
<br>
<br>
<b>Date Nights in an Unforgettable City</b> — Fall in love with a gorgeous city made for romance! Ciudad Enamorada has 3 neighborhoods that exude charm with plenty of places for Sims to meet, flirt and even WooHoo. There’s even a new Singles Hangout lot trait that’ll attract available Sims to come and mingle.</p>

<p>Young Adult Sims and older can access Cupid's Corner from phones and computers to match with other Sims from the world or the Gallery. That's right, your dating pool includes the entire Gallery! The app has 3 sections. In About Me, take a selfie for your Sim's bio and choose which of their traits to display. The app curates matches based on your Sim's age preferences and sexual orientation.

<p>Create a date! Choose what type of date you want to have, select the venue, invite more Sims if you'd like, and choose your activities. Dates will have goals depending on the activities you choose. Other Sims won't interrupt your date unless you invite them into a conversation, and you can change the venue of an in-progress date if a change of scenery is in order *WINK*. Just like in real life, if the date isn't going well, the other Sim can end it early.</p>

<p>Sims have new ways to connect, with new games and a grown-up costume box. They can also feed each other from shareable treat boxes, cuddle in bed, or share special moments on the Romantic Blanket. This portable blanket is always there for you whether you want to snuggle, kiss, or WooHoo. Just remember: love can be dangerous. Sims who experience too much back-to-back heartache could die of a broken heart.</p>
